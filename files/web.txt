When their natural prey is scarce, lions can cause grave losses to livestock, which can massively reduce the income of local people. We support the Mara Predator Conservation\xa0Programme\xa0(MPCP) in Kenya, which monitors and protects lions and educates local people on lion conservation. With partners, we’re\xa0supporting\xa0the first ever national lion census in Kenya – using a survey technique\xa0developed\xa0by MPCP - to determine how many lions live here and how best to safeguard them.', 'score': 0.9992563, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://davidshepherd.org/species/lions/threats/', 'title': 'Threats to Lions - David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation', 'content': 'Lions Home Species We Protect Lions Threats to Lions # Threats to Lions ## The Four Main Threats to Lions How we help protect Lions Change in land use from human pressure is leaving lion populations isolated, reducing their habitats and the habitats of their prey species. The fragmentation of lion habitats across Africa means their populations are disconnected, reducing genetic diversity, and providing an additional barrier to the recovery of this iconic species. These exports continue to stimulate demand and incentivise poaching, pushing lion populations closer to the edge of extinction. Climate change poses one of the largest threats to lion populations in the 21st\xa0Century and, if left unchecked, could have serious implications on the survival of this iconic species.', 'score': 0.99827254, 'raw_content': None}]
